# 🧠 Alzheimer Disease Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of Alzheimer's disease using clinical and cognitive data. Achieved **93% accuracy** using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier.

## 📊 Project Overview

- Performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Selected 5 most relevant features out of 32 using statistical insights
- Built and evaluated a KNN classifier (k=5, Manhattan distance)
- Visualized key patterns and model performance

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Model Performance

- **Model:** KNN (k=5, Manhattan distance)
- **Accuracy:** 93%

## 🗃️ Data

Data sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/alzheimers-disease-dataset

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Try other classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, SVM)
- Perform hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
- Deploy model as a web app (e.g., with Streamlit)
